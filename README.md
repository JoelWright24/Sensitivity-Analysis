# Sensitivity Analysis

The repository, Sensitivity Analysis, is a small toolbox for analysing the sensitivity of systems.

So far, "Latin Hypercube Sampling" and "One Factor at a Time" methodolgies for sensitivity analysis have been considered and implimented in seperate python scripts. These represent local and global methods of sensitivity analysis respectivly.

See the ReadMe files in each of their respective directories for more information.
